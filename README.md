A simple frontend skeleton for use in quickly prototyping ideas

### TODO:
- Use Bower for pulling in front end dependencies like jQuery, Backbone, etc.
- Re-setup initial test structure with either Mocha or Jasmine
- Get a build setup going
- Get an initial router setup and some actual decent initial starter code
- Bring in some of my Backbone view/layout management conventions
